# Linked-List
A doubly circular linked-list data structure that has easy functions but powerful performance.

### Features:
* Simple and very easy to learn :)
* Good performance
* Flexible with big data & small data
* Clean memory (just call a function)
* The 'sort' function, implementation with 'timsort' algorithm (very fast)
* Find, remove and update of each cell with index or value!
* The 'reverse' function, for reversing the linked list simply

Just read `sample.c` for learning all things about this project and use it :wink:
