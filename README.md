# Linked-List
A doubly circular linked-list data structure that has easy functions but powerful performance.

### Features:
* simple and very easy to learn:))
* good performance
* flexible with big data and small data
* clean memory (just call a function!)
* the 'sort' function, implementation with 'timsort' algorithm (very fast)
* find, remove and update of each cell with index or value!
* the 'reverse' function, for reversing the linked list simply

Just read `sample.c` for learning all things about this project and use it :wink:
